    <p>
      I am Amir and I build web applications. I have 3,4 years of industry experience. <br><br> I could waste your
      time by building a thorough website that would attempt to convince you that I know about X and Y
      and establish that Y is important to me.<br><br>
      But ultimately, my preference and skills are as temporary as every language I know and as fickle
as every tool I use; as temporary as things that will be useless in 10 years; as fickle as things that
can be learned by anyone.<br><br>
      The things that last are not complete, they are in progress. <br><br>So what I will tell you is that I am in progress.
      I hold on to my methods loosely, embrace flexibility and modularity, I am willing to learn, expect to be wrong,
      and am confident when Iâ€™m right.<br><br>
      Regards, Amir
